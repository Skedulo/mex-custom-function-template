# Mobile Extension Custom Function Template

## About

The mobile extension custom functions are built to provide a solution to support businesses' needs. They allow users to do the following things:
* Customize how their custom form fetches and saves data.
* Use both GraphQL and REST APIs to fetch or save data.
* Apply custom business logic using TypeScript.

For more details, refer to the [Custom Functions](https://docs.skedulo.com/developer-guides/customize-and-extend-mobile/skedulo-plus-extensions/getting-started/custom-function/) article on the Skedulo Docs site.

This repository contains a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html) template to help you quickly create a mobile extension custom function project.

## Create a custom function project

1. Install cookiecutter

```bash
OSX: brew install cookiecutter

Other: pip install cookiecutter
```

2. Run the command to generate a new project from template

```bash
cookiecutter git@github.com:Skedulo/mex-custom-function-template.git
```

You will be prompted to provide the name and slug for the new project
```bash
project_name [My New Project]:
project_slug [project slug]:

```

The following template variables control execution:

| Parameter | Description|
|-----------|------------|
| project_name | Human readable description of the project.  e.g. My New Service|
| project_slug | This is the name of the directory where the project will be rendered as well as the name of the major artifact generated by the project|


3. Validate and then push to github
